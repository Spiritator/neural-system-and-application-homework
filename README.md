## HW1
Build a back propagation MLP from scratch.
I build it with momentum weight updating and batch training.

## HW2
Use radial basis function ANN to simulate the function f(x,y) with radial basis function is Gaussian function and standard deviation is dmax/sqrt(m1).

## HW3
Use LVQ neural network to classify 20 2D vector out of 3 classes.
